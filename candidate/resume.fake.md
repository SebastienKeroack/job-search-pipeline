## SUMMARY
Machine learning and software developer (Python, C++, PyTorch/TensorFlow) targeting entry-level / junior roles. Built ML prototypes (classification, anomaly detection, NLP) and end-to-end projects spanning data collection, model training, evaluation, and deployment tooling (Docker/Kubernetes). Self-taught engineer (programming since 2010) with experience across web, systems, and ML.

### TARGET ROLES
- Entry-level: Machine Learning Engineer, Python Backend Engineer, Data Engineer, Platform/Cloud Engineer
- Junior: Machine Learning Engineer, Backend Engineer (Python), Data Engineer, Platform Engineer
- Early-career: Associate Software Engineer (Backend/ML)
- Open to related roles: data/ML pipelines, automation, QA/test automation, support engineering

## TECHNICAL SKILLS
Scoring legend:
- 1 = basic (can follow tutorials; needs supervision) - entry-level exposure
- 2 = familiar (can contribute; needs guidance) - entry-level
- 3 = intermediate (can deliver scoped tasks with some autonomy) - junior-to-mid
- 4 = advanced (can design/ship independently) - strong mid-level
- 5 = expert (can teach/mentor; deep experience) - senior+

## EXPERIENCE

### Freelance Machine Learning Developer | Quebec, QC | Mar 2020 - Apr 2020
- Built a hybrid intrusion-detection prototype combining signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection to improve detection of previously unseen attacks.
- Implemented and evaluated decision tree and SVM baselines; produced confusion matrices and metrics dashboards to guide iteration.
- Designed a PyTorch model to emulate a Wallace tree multiplier (1-4 bit); improved model accuracy by 83%.

Tech: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## PROJECTS

### Portfolio website (multilingual) | Feb 2023 - Nov 2025
- Designed and built a multilingual website with structured content, responsive UI, adaptive themes, and SEO-friendly metadata.
- Implemented CAPTCHA-protected forms and deployed on a PHP server.

Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Node.js

### Neural Architecture Search (reinforcement learning + Kubernetes) | Mar 2021 - May 2023
- Built a TensorFlow controller to generate candidate architectures using reinforcement learning and optimization.
- Orchestrated training jobs on Kubernetes; collected results and centralized storage using Reverb.

Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Reverb

### FX sentiment analysis (NLP) | Feb 2020 - Mar 2021
- Automated data collection with Selenium; cleaned, tokenized, and curated text datasets.
- Built a web labeling interface to create a supervised dataset.
- Fine-tuned a pretrained BERT model for sentiment classification.

Tech: Python, Selenium, TensorFlow, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript

### Deep learning library (C++/CUDA) | Feb 2016 - Nov 2019
- Implemented a C++/CUDA deep learning library with hand-coded backpropagation (no autograd), focusing on performance and memory efficiency.
- Built tooling and integration using CMake and MSVC.

Tech: C++, CUDA, CMake, MSVC, Visual Studio, C++/CLI (.NET)

### Automated trading bot | 2015
- Learned MQL4 and built a trading bot prototype (experimentation; unreliable results), which sparked my move toward deep learning.

Tech: MQL4

### 3D video game prototype (Unity3D/C#) | 2013
- Game prototype with core mechanics (movement, NPCs, combat, health, inventory, equipment, buffs, customization).

Tech: Unity 3D 4.x, C#, Visual Studio/MonoDevelop, Blender (basic familiarity)
